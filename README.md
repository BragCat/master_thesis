# What's this repo?
**master_thesis** is my graduation thesis that applied for master degree of computer science.

It contains the finalized PDF version of my thesis, which is named as "基于IPv6源地址验证的用户身份识别与溯源技术研究.pdf". The repo also includes all the LaTex files needed to generate the PDF version of my thesis.

# What's the thesis talking about？
The thesis talks about a bottom-up research architecture of user identification and traceability based on IPv6 source address validation. With the cooperation of the IPv6 source address validation technology in access network, intra-AS network and inter-AS network, this framework can provide network access service to trusted users while keeping the ability to prevent malicious behaviors such as IP address forgery and trace the user identity to hold the malicious users accountable. Meanwhile, it utilizes the blockchain to enhance its infrastructure to protect itself from DDoS attack.
